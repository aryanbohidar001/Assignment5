Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks and Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing 
# Assignment 5

This repository contains solutions to two tasks:

## Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

**File:** `Task1.py`

This script creates a dictionary containing student names and their corresponding marks.  
- The user is prompted to enter a student's name.
- If the name exists in the dictionary, the script prints the student's marks.
- If the name does not exist, it prints "student not found."

**Example Usage:**
```
Enter the student's name: Aryan
Aryan's marks: 95
```

## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

**File:** `Task2.py`

This script demonstrates basic list slicing and manipulation.
- It creates a list of integers from 1 to 10.
- Extracts the first five elements using slicing.
- Reverses the sliced list and prints the result.

**Output Example:**
```
Original list:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements:[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
